# **snippets folder**

A folder with the snippet.

## **snippets/snippets.json**

* File with the readable snippet, this file will not be interpreted by VSCode to use the snippet.
* When the user installs the extension from the marketplace this file will not be downloaded but will help any developer to check the theme settings.

## **snippets/snippets-min.json**

* File with the code that the snippet is using and VSCode will interpret, but it is minified so the file will take less room in your hard drive and will perform a little bit better.
